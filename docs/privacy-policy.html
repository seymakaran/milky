    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 09/08/2025</p>
    <p>As <strong>ODEgames</strong>, we highly prioritize the privacy of children and parents. This Privacy Policy applies to our applications on both <strong>Android (Google Play)</strong> and <strong>iOS (App Store)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Our applications <strong>do not collect personal information</strong> such as email, phone number, name, or location from children or parents. No account or sign-in is required.</p>

    <h3>1.2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect limited, <strong>anonymous and non-personal data</strong> to improve app performance and deliver ads:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Crash/diagnostic reports (to resolve technical issues)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <h3>2.1. Advertising</h3>
    <p>Our apps include <strong>third-party advertisements</strong> provided by trusted ad networks that comply with child-privacy policies (e.g., AdMob, Unity Ads). These networks may use anonymous identifiers for ad delivery, frequency capping, and fraud prevention.</p>
    <p><strong>After a successful in-app purchase (Unlock All Games), all advertisements are permanently removed.</strong></p>
    <p>Ad network privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Unity Ads Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. Analytics</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics (e.g., Firebase, Unity Analytics) to collect only <strong>anonymous and aggregated usage data</strong> to improve app performance and fix errors. No personal or identifiable information is collected.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>

    <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect data. However, no internet transmission or storage system is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Updates to Privacy Policy</h2>
